# Deployment
 I have used SQL Server Management Studio 20, Power BI and DevOps for deploying my project. First I used MS SQL server for importing data till Week 52 and additional Week 53 data at the end. Then, I loaded my SQL Server Tabular data into Power BI and used it to make an interactive and insightful dashboard. After the project is done, I have used Devops to connect my Github repo such that I can deploy this on open Web.
 Hence, I have used two of the major Azure technologies that the FRT project requires.
